Maintainers are the people who keep a package or sub-package working. In particular, they review and merge PRs, keep track of what's going on and organize ideas for future development (see https://www.astropy.org/team.html#Subpackage_maintainer for details). Therefore, a maintainer usually has experience with a package e.g. through work they did themselves or by commenting and helping others to work on PRs in a package or sub-package. There is no formal minimum on the number of commits/PRs/etc. though, anyone can volunteer or be suggested as a maintainer following the process below.

This document describes the process for adding new people to maintainer roles.
"Maintainer" here basically means any role with github write powers. The
process is in the hands of the Coordination Committee according to
[APE0](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst). The process is:

1. Either the Coordination Committee or any community member including the 
   nominee may nominate someone for a role via private or public email,
   Slack message, in person request that is then recorded in meeting notes, etc.
2. A Coordination Committee member then sends a message to the person
   nominated, making sure they understand the role, its responsibilities, and
   confirming that the nominee agrees. Suggested text of that message is 
   [here](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/messages/maintainer_access.md).
3. If the nominee does not accept, the process stops here.
4. If the nominee does accept, a message is sent to the community, starting
   a two-week clock on the feedback period [as required by APE0](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst#responsibilities-and-authority).
   The Coordination Committee member overseeing the process can make a PR at
   this time adding the member to the roles page as a place for public comment.
5. Once the two week period has elapsed, the coordination committee makes a
   final decision based on any feedback. 
6. If the appointment is confirmed, the nominee is added to the roles page (i.e., the PR created in step 4 can
   be merged), and the nominee receives the necessary Github or other 
   permissions and a confirmation message to complete the process.
