This document describes the process for adding new people to named roles. This
document is *not* about how people are nominated for a role in the first place,
but rather the process by which they are added once nominated. The
process itself is in the hands of the Coordination Committee according to
[APE0](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst).

Note some of the steps below are highlighted as specific for maintainers.
Maintainers are the people who keep a package or sub-package working. In
particular, they review and merge PRs, keep track of what's going on and
organize ideas for future development (see
https://www.astropy.org/team.html#Subpackage_maintainer
for details). Therefore, a maintainer requires particular Github permissions,
which is highlighted in the process below.

The process is:

1. A Coordination Committee member sends a message to the person
   nominated, making sure they understand the role, its responsibilities, and
   confirming that the nominee agrees. Suggested text of that message is
   [here](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/messages/maintainer_access.md).
2. The nominee should also be asked (generally but not necessarily in the
   message above) to confirm they agree the Code of Conduct, and that they are
   aware of maintainer guidelines if the role is a maintainer role.
3. If the nominee does not accept, the process stops here.
4. If the nominee does accept, a message is sent to the community, starting
   a two-week clock on the feedback period [as required by APE0](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst#responsibilities-and-authority).
   The Coordination Committee member overseeing the process should make a PR at
   this time adding the member to the roles page as a place for public comment.
5. Once the two week period has elapsed, the coordination committee makes a
   final decision based on any feedback.
6. If the appointment is confirmed, the nominee is added to the roles page
   (i.e., the PR created in step 4 can be merged).
7. The nominee receives the necessary GitHub or other permissions for the new role.
8. The nominee gets added to the astropy-core-maintainers mailing list.
9. The Coordination Committee member sends a confirmation message to the nominee
   to complete the process.
