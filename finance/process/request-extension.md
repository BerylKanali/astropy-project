# Guidelines for Requesting a Project Extension

In general, projects financially supported by Astropy are subject to contracts or other agreements with a specified period of performance.
Under normal circumstances, we expect the work to be completed within that period.
However, we recognize that this is sometimes impossible and that an extension may be necessary.

In order to request an extension to an approved proposal, the entity (person or organization) responsible for carrying out the work should open a new pull request to update the document describing the approved proposal as stored in the [astropy-project repository](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project).
The PR should add a new section to the existing proposal text which specifies:

- What work will be undertaken during the period covered by the extension.
  In particular, please be sure to note if the full scope of the original proposal is *not* expected to be completed during the extension.
- The funds that will be spent during the extension.
- The new end date for the project.

Note that this mechanism can only be used to extend the period of performance of an approved proposal: this is not the appropriate mechanism to propose an increase in the amount of funding required to complete the work.
Additional funding should be requested by creating an [entirely new funding proposal](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/finance/process/request-funding.md#contract-work).
