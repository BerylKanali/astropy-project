The Astropy project wants to make life easy for all the volunteers and people working towards our shared goal; on the other hand, we also need to make sure we spend grant money in a fiscally responsible way and as allowed by donors or funding agencies. This policy thus aims to strike a balance between as little bureaucracy as possible while also ensuring that money is spend responsibly and that Astropy has all the documentation that we required for any of the grants given to Astropy.



Funding requests can be made to the Interim Astropy Finance Committee.  The following provides a description for how to obtain funding for different types of activities. 
If you have questions on how to apply the rules, please email finance@astropy.org .


## Travel

1. Send an email to finance@astropy.org with the following information:
* Name
* Description
* Total Request
* Itemized Budget
* Advance needed

Costs for per diem can use the [US Government per diem rates | https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates].   

Flights above $175 x length of flight in hours should provide justification for the additional costs.  Within these costs, we encourage developers to optimize their travel for productivity.   Medical reasons are acceptable justification for higher costs.   

2. The interim finance committee will aim to provide approval within 1 week of the request.


3.  Travel occurs

4.  Preferable within two weeks of completing the trip, travel costs are submitted via the [NumFOCUS Rocket form | https://numfocus.org/rocket]

5. NumFOCUS provides the information for approval to the Finance Committee.

6. At least, one member of the finance committee provides approval for the payment.

7. Payment is made by NumFocus, typically within 30 days.


## Contractor Work

This document describes how the process has been handled in the past, when funding was available through specific grants for very well defined tasks. The interim finance committee and the community as a whole are engaging in a discussion how to handle this going forward.

1.  A request for contract work should be made via email to finance@astropy.org.

2.  If the request is not coming from the coordination committee, the finance committee will seek approval for this contract from the Coordination Committee   

3.  The terms of the contract work are negotiated (by FC? by NumFOCUS?)  

4.  The contract is approved by a majority (>50%) of the finance committee.  In cases where a substantial portion of the committee is conflicted on the decision, approval requires unanimous approval of the unconflicted members.

5.  The contract begins.  Hours worked are reported through the [NumFOCUS Rocket form | https://numfocus.org/rocket]. 

6.  NumFOCUS provides the information for approval to the Finance Committee.

7.   At least one member of the finance committee provides approval for the payment.  

8.   Payment is made to the contractor.

9.   Contracts should be reviewed yearly.   If necessary, renewals or extensions can be requested via email to finance@astropy.org.


## Any other requests for funding

Any other requests for funding should be made via an email to finance@astropy.org.   Please include your name, an explanation of the funding being requested, and a budget.


## General policies

The interim finance committee may need to revise this policy on an a case-by-case basis as needed and will make every effort to revise this policy as needed.
