#. The Committee should notify the Coordination Committee where they believe the priorities set by the latter may not be aligned with the views of the wider community.
   This is particularly important when members of the Committee may, as part of Committee business, have access to information which is not available to the community at large.

   (Agreed `2020-02-07`__.)

#. The scope of the Committee is not limited to any particular source of funding; rather, the Committee is charged with maintaining an oversight on — and, where appropriate, direct management of — all Astropy-controlled funding instruments.
   In the event that external bodies wish to provide support to Astropy that is not directly financial (for example, by employing somebody to work on Astropy), the Committee need not be consulted or otherwise involved, but will be available to assist with the process upon request.

   (Agreed `2020-06-26`__.)
