Call for proposals: 
Inclusion, Diversity, and Empowerment
We recognize that contributing to open source projects is a privilege not available to everyone and that the Astropy Project community is highly white, predominantly male, and is homogeneous in several other ways, too. In our [code of conduct](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html), we committed to being an inclusive and welcoming community, but clearly it’s not enough to write down a commitment, there needs to be action too. Hence, we urge all Astropy community members to take action to broaden participation in the Project at all levels and we want to empower those actions.

Often, such actions require resources and thus the Project asks for proposals from members of the community for up to $15,000 for any action that helps with inclusion, support, and empowerment of underrepresented or marginalized groups in the Astropy community. We are looking for proposals that lead to concrete actions soon, preferably in the next six months. 

We envision an open and collaborative process for proposals and the proposal review, where ideas are opened as pull requests in the astropy/project repo (see template below), similar to the way APEs are suggested, discussed and improved. That way any community member can comment on, flesh out, add details to, and improve proposals. Similar to hack day pitches, proposers do not need to have the needed team already assembled and we envision the proposal process as an opportunity for teams to be recruited and formed.

We hope that an open discussion will encourage people with similar ideas to join forces and that the community will converge on one or two proposals to be supported. This relies on community members to provide honest and constructive feedback and input to see which proposals can be realistically executed with the resources we have and have the most positive impact.

If there is no consensus by end of August, the following process will be used to decide: The CoCo will select 4-5 proposals that are (i) fundable through the Moore grant, (ii) fleshed out in enough detail that work and funding can happen on a six-month time scale, and (iii) have the most community buy-in (counting number of contributors and positive comments in the PR from distinct people).  We will then invite the community to comment on those proposals specifically and, should a tie-break be necessary, the CoCo will make a decision on September 15th.

This initiative was inspired by recent events in the US, but we stress that proposals may target any  underrepresented or marginalized groups worldwide and Project-specific challenges. We also want to emphasize that proposals can be outward facing (e.g., focusing on recruitment) or inward facing (e.g., working on existing practices in our community which may be exclusionary).  

Funding for this comes from the Moore grant to the Astropy Project, which includes $15,000 for “mentoring” in the budget year Nov 2019 to Oct 2020, thus one or more proposals with a total cost of $15,000 can be funded. For proposals that do not fit under the “mentoring” proposed in the Moore grant, the finance committee will try to find alternative funds. Likely, that will require to shift other spending between budget items and thus the total cap of $15,000 still applies.


Template
Think of this like a hack day pitch or a github issue for discussion, not like a funding  proposal to a government agency. Short and informal is encouraged.
