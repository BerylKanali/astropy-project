### Copy Edit the Astropy Documentation and Improve the Style Guide

### Project Team

Lauren Glattly

### Proposal Summary

This proposal is to pay $14,400 to improve the Astropy Style Guide and complete the previously started project of copy editing the full documentation.

This project benefits the Astropy documentation by ensuring that language, punctuation, and formatting is consistent throughout the subpackages, which in turn benefits Astropy users by increasing clarity and creating a more uniform and coherent experience for the Astropy community. This project also benefits Astropy contributors by providing an improved and comprehensive style guide to serve as a narrative writing resource.

### Proposed Work

In a previous proposal, all Astropy documentation except for five subpackages (development, modeling, utils, visualization, and WCS) received a first round of copy editing and the insertion of temporary example gallery markup while the current style guide was also in development.

Phase one of this project proposes improvements to the current style guide, including more writing guidelines for reference sections and accessibility, as well as a possible changelog or version number to better track copy editing work and documentation copy editing status in the future.

Phase two of this project proposes a full audit of previously copy edited documentation subpackages to check for adherence to any new guidelines in the style guide while simultaneously changing the previously added temporary example gallery markup to the actual example gallery extension. Phase two also proposes a more rigorous first round copy edit of the documentation subpackages which did not initially receive an edit, while simultaneously identifying and marking examples with the example gallery extension.

This proposal includes the copy editing of pull requests that affect the documentation and the editing of other Astropy materials as assigned.

### Budget

$14,400 with billing based on actual hours worked.
