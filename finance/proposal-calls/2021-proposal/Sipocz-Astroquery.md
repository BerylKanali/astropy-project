# Proposal

Astroquery community manager and infrastructure refactoring
===========================================================

### Project team

This proposal is fund new community initiatives for astroquery as well as the long overdue restructuring of the package, and continued maintainer involvement of: 

* Brigitta Sip≈ëcz

### Project Summary

* The proposal has 3 main components two of which are new directions:
    * Establishing community calls, and organize workshop
    * Refactoring packaging, fixing versioning and continuous deployment, and restructuring the structure of modules
    * Continue maintenance work, focusing on reviewing large PRs from archival contributors


### Project / work

####
* Community management
    * New: Organize community calls. Contributors expressed large interest for these type of calls, and indeed pilot calls were well received and were very productive.
    * Organize and participate and astroquery workshop. Such workshop generated large interest, but hasn't materialized due to lock down.

* Infrastructure refactoring and maintanance. Some critical issues:
    * APE17 has to be implemented
    * New versioning scheme is required for CD
    * CD infrastructure has to be fixed
    * Package module structure is agreed to be refactored to ensure better user experience with ever growing number of modules
    
* Continue as maintainer with special focus on
    * reviews of big PRs
    * oversee CD/CI, perform manual releases, coordinate with packagers
    * communicate with external development teams

Note: the last bulletin, maintenance overlaps with the other astroquery funding proposal, and if preferred this proposal can be split into to make my share of the work included in that one rather then here.
