# Proposal

### Title

Guides, `ccdproc` and packaging

### Project team

Matt Craig

### Project Summary

Provide support for infrastructure of astropy and coordinated packages,
including continuous integration, conda packaging. Perform ongoing maintenance of
coordinated package `ccdproc`, continued development of the CCD guide and start a
photometry guide.

### Project / work

+ **conda packaging**: Maintain the conda packages on conda-forge for the core,
  coordinated, and infrastructure packages, keep the astropy conda channel
  up-to-date, and manage migration to the `conda-forge` channel as the
  user-facing channel.
+ **Reviews of pull requests to project packages**: Review pull requests
  submitted to the core, coordinated, and infrastructure packages on which I have
  expertise.
+ **Implement extensive refactor of `ccdproc` image combination API**: The
  current `ccdproc` API is somewhat cumbersome for building pipelines. The
  refactoring,
  [suggested several years ago](https://github.com/astropy/ccdproc/issues/578),
  will fix that.
+ **Package template maintenance**: Contribute to maintaining the astropy
  package-template by helping review existing and new pull requests and opening
  new pull requests for the highest priority issues.
+ **Polish the CCD reduction guide**: The first edition of the guide
  is available [rendered here](). Work is almost complete on hosting the rendered book as part of the [source repository](). Updates to the book will be
  published as "editions" from the source repository, with past editions
  available so that instructors can pick an edition for use in courses
  and use that edition until they are ready to upgrade. Sections on science image
  combination and constructing sky flats remaining to be completed and will be
  done as part of this work.
+ **Write first edition of photometry guide**: Write the first edition of a guide
  to photometry with `astropy` and `photutils`, implemented as a
  [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/index.html).
