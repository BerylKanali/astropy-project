# Proposal

### Astroquery Maintenance

### Adam Ginsburg, Brigitta Sipocz, Clara Brasseur

### Project Summary
We will continue maintenance of astroquery, particularly handling the increased workload of onboarding new collaboration teams and interacting with them (e.g., ESA, IRSA, ALMA/CADC, CDS).

### Project / work

Continue roles as astroquery maintainers:
 * Respond to issues
 * Review pull requests
 * Forward issues to the appropriate parties when upstream issues are noted
 * Adapt to changing APIs
 * Communicate with external development teams

### Budget
currency: US $
Include overheads, fringe etc. if money is paid as sub-grant (note that the Moore grant caps overhead at 15%).

- Salary:

 * Adam Ginsburg: 1/12th FTE (1 month effort), $19000 including overheads (though this may need to be renegotiated re: Moore limitations)
 * Brigitta Sipocz: covered under PR [#192](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/pull/192)
 * Clara Brasseur: 1/12th FTE (1 month effort), $15000 including overheads
