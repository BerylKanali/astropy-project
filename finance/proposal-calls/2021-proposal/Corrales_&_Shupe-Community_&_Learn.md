## Learn Astropy Maintenance Funding Proposal

### Project Team

This funding proposal is for a sub-award to University of Michigan
that will support the following people in the Learn Astropy Project:
* Lia Corrales - tutorial content lead and a leader in the Learn
  Astropy community
* Ana Gabela - administrative support
* Undergraduate work-study student - for testing and updating tutorial
  content

We are also requesting funding for independent contractors:
* David Shupe (IPAC) - workshop leader and content maintainer
* Mariana Meireles - community study consultant

### Project description

This funding request covers ongoing maintenance of Learn Astropy
activities as well as some crucial tasks needed to bring the Learn
Astropy tutorials library into convergence with the latest releases of
Astropy.

#### Learn Astropy project maintenance

Lia Corrales is the primary person responsible for coordinating the
project by scheduling Learn Astropy telecons and maintaining the Learn
Astropy Initiatives project board. She coordinates efforts of various
team members, including website infrastructure, documentation, and new
content development. She also acts as reviewer and frequent
collaborator for new tutorial content pull requests. She typically
logs about 120 hours per year on the Learn Astropy project (0.75
person-months, reflected in the budget request).

We are requesting administrative support for activities that are
normally undertaken by Lia Corrales around AAS exhibit hall and
workshop periods, which will free time for her to focus more on Learn
Astropy content. The administrative assistant, Ana Gabela, already
works with Lia and is an authorized contractor through University of
Michigan. She will provide assistance in organizing the Astropy
exhibit hall presence for future AAS meetings; designing,
administering and summarizing survey assessments of the Astropy
workshops; and organizing meeting schedules. We estimate that this
will take up 20 hours over the course of the year.

A crucial task for keeping the Learn Astropy website useful for the
community is ensuring that it is up-to-date. The sub-award to UM will
be used to fund undergraduate work-study. The student will be
responsible for testing all current notebooks, bringing them up to
date with the latest version of Astropy, and assessing the notebooks
for future improvement. This is a useful input that can seed new
tutorial ideas and recruit new tutorial content developers and Astropy
contributors. We anticipate hiring 1-2 students for 6 hours per week.

#### Astropy Workshop maintenance and growth

David Shupe is the primary person responsible for soliciting and
coordinating volunteers for Astropy Workshops offered at meetings of
the American Astronomical Society (AAS). We have traditionally held
workshops once per year at the Winter AAS meetings. This work has
grown to two half-day workshops (AAS 237) and is becoming a
semi-annual event with the inclusion of an Astropy Workshop for the
Summer AAS meeting (AAS 238).

Workshop coordination includes: preparing workshop proposals,
currently to the AAS; setting the workshop schedule of presentations
including the presenters; updating and refining the installation
instructions; maintaining the astropy-workshop repository and
reviewing pull requests for updated content; and communicating with
workshop registrants prior to and during each workshop.

#### Astropy community survey and demographics

Mariana Meireles is a software engineer at QuantStack developing tools
for the NumFOCUS ecosystem, focusing on Jupyter products. Prior to
QuantStack she worked as a developer on the PySide team at the Qt
Company and as a web performance developer at Mozilla in the WebCompat
team.

Mariana has experience in using the Github API to examine contributor
demographics in open source communities. We would like to hire her as
a consultant for the Learn Astropy team to develop surveys and
techniques to examine Astropy user and contributor demographics. She
will also help us build a survey to examine usersâ€™ needs from the
Learn Astropy ecosystem -- tutorial availability, Astropy tasks
desired (which can inform the future of the project as well as
learning materials), and performance. This will be a small project
that will dovetail with the demographic studies undertaken by the
NumFocus DISC community; we anticipate approximately 10 hours of work.

### Budget

The total requests sum to $19,650

Sub-award to UM:
* Corrales Summer Salary, 0.75 months = $10,000 (including fringe)
* Administrator: 20 hours of work at $50 per hour = $1,000
* Undergraduate work-study: 110 hours of work at $15 per hour = $1,650
* Total: $12,650

Independent contractor work for David Shupe (workshops): per workshop, 30 hours of
work at $100 per hour; two workshops per year = $6000

Independent contractor work for Mariana Meireles (Community Survey): 10 hours of work at
$100 per hour = $1000

#### Potential budget ranges

Minimal budget ($7,400):
* Corrales Summer Salary, 0.25 months = $3,400
* Gabela administrative support, 20 hours = $1,000
* Shupe workshop support, $50 per hour = $3,000

Medium budget ($13,100)
* Corrales Summer Salary, 0.5 months = $6,700
* Gabela administrative support, 20 hours = $1,000
* Shupe workshop support, $75 per hour = $4,500
* Undergraduate work-study, 60 hours of work at $15 per hour = $900

Maximum budget -- see above. Based on new activity by NumFOCUS DISC,
we may decide to delay any detailed demographic study within the
Astropy community for a different year. In that case, the finance
committee may remove the Community Survey line item, which reduces the
total budget request to $18,650.
