#Astropy participation in Outreachy

##Summary

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) is a well established, impactful internship initiative with 
a good track record and a very clear eligibility criteria to support people from 
[groups underrepresented in the technology industry](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/eligibility/).
Interns work remotely with mentors from Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities on projects.

##Plan

The team, consisting of experienced Google Summer of Code (GSoC) organizational admins, will 
coordinate the participation, and if additional fund raising allows join Astropy efforts with other
OpenAstronomy projects (e.g. Sunpy). Proposing project ideas, and volunteering for mentoring will
be open to the wider Astropy team, similarly to GSoC.

##Impact

As it was highlighted in the call for proposal the Astropy community is extremely biased in many 
axes. This proposal combines the original mentoring intent of the funding in the Moore grant with
Diversity and Inclusion aspirations.
Outreachy has an excellent track record to tap into talent pools that none of the usual Astropy
efforts reach. The internship provides a long coding mentorship for people from underrepresented 
groups, as well as some mentoring to gain familiarity with open source workflows for the people
participating in the earlier, and shorter contributing phase Outreachy.

##Budget

We propose to fund at least one intern, with the budget of $6500. Additional placements might 
come from a larger budget allocation. To participate as a mentoring organization in Outreachy 
FOSS communities need to have secured funding for at least one intern ($6,500). The budget covers
the internship stipend, intern travel stipend, and Outreachy’s accounting fee.
