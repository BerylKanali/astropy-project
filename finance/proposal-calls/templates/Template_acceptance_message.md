Hi *NAME*,

I'm writing on behalf of Astropy's Finance Committee regarding the outcome of your recent proposal (https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/pull/*NUMBER*).

We are pleased to be able to let you know that, following consultation with the community, we are able to award you a total of *$NUMBER (US)* to carry out the project.

The next steps are:

- Please make sure that you are registered with Open Collective (https://opencollective.com): this is the system you will use to submit your invoices for payment.
  Note that your invoices should be submitted through the *PROJECTNAME (URL)* project on Open Collective.

- We will reach out through NumFOCUS, Astropy's Fiscal Sponsor, to set up an “independent contractor agreement” (ICA; effectively a contract) and formal scope of work for the project.

We expect the work to be carried out between *START-DATE* and *END-DATE* (the “period of performance”).
If you come to realise that the work will take more time than originally planned, you can apply for an extension following the procedure described at https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/finance/process/request-extension.md.

Congratulations --- we are really looking forward to seeing you put these funds to good use!

*NAME*
On behalf of the Astropy Finance Committee
