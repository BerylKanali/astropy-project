### Project Team
Clara Brasseur

### Project Description

Continue maintenance work in my role as maintainer of astroquery, February through December 2023.

I am asking for the half the amount of money/funded developer hours I did last cycle for two reasons. 1) I have requested an extension to last years contract that will fund my work through February 2023. 2) I am requesting what amounts to a small reduction in hours per week to be more in line with my ongoing availability. 

### Project / Work
A combination of maintenance and enhancement work on the astroquery coordinated pakage.

Maintenance work:
 * Respond to issues
 * Review pull requests
 * Forward issues to the appropriate parties when upstream issues are noted
 * Adapt to changing APIs
 * Communicate with external development teams

Enhancement work:
 * Improve caching capabilities
 * Improve developer documentation

### Approximate Budget

Currency: US $7500

 * Salary: 6375 (1/24 FTE, 1/2 month developer time)
 * Overhead: 1125 (%15)


Minimum viable budget: $5000
A lower award would simply limit the amount of time for enhancement work.
