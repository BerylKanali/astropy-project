# Core Package Maintainer support for Derek Homeier

### Project Team
Derek Homeier

### Project Description
Continue role as astropy core and io.ascii maintainer and responder
to user support and contributor's issues

### Project / Work

#### Continue and expand roles of astropy core general maintainer and affiliated package editor.
Building on the [Cycle II Project](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/finance/proposal-calls/2021-proposal/Homeier-Core%2C_Spectroscopy.md).

- Participate in telecons and developer meeting organisation as appropriate.

- Participate in HPC and Spectroscopy/NDdata working groups.

- Begin work on a `meson` build environment for astropy core and test its suitability for
  core package builds.
  
#### Continue role as astropy.io.ascii maintainer.

- Investigate integration of the `loadtxt` C parser available with Numpy 1.23.

#### Support for Software Operations in responding to support requests:

- Monitor Openastronomy Discourse, Facebook Python in Astronomy groups, Slack channels, mailing
  list and Github issues for questions in need of response, identifying potential assignees.

- Review PRs especially from new/first time contributors.

### Budget
currency: US $

- Contractor fees: 8 hours weekly for a total of 352 hours (accounting for holidays) @ $120 / hour

- TOTAL: $42,240

Expanded from the 2021 request to support increased activity in my new roles; with the
previously approved amount some work like `specutils` contributions had to be scaled down.

- Minimum viable amount: estimated at $21,120 for 4 hr / week

As some of the spectroscopy-related tasks here may overlap with other proposals,
and moderation of the Discourse, Slack and Facebook user support groups would be
largely taken over by the community engagement coordinator position, when filled,
that level should allow continuation of maintainer and editorial work in all 3
formal team positions as well as some contribution to NDData development.

### Approved Budget
$42,240 (Moore)

### Extesion

The Finance Committee agreed to increase the approved bydget by $14,400 to a total of $56,640.
