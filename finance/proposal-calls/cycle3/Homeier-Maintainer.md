# Core Package Maintainer support for Derek Homeier

### Project Team
Derek Homeier

### Project Description
Continue role as astropy core and io.ascii maintainer and responder
to support and contributor's issues

### Project / Work

#### Continue and expand roles of astropy core general manager and affiliated package editor.
Building on the [Cycle II Project](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/finance/proposal-calls/2021-proposal/Homeier-Core%2C_Spectroscopy.md).

- Participate in telecons and developer meeting organisation as appropriate.

- Participate in HPC and Spectroscopy/NDdata working groups.

- Begin work on a `meson` build environment for astropy core and test its suitability for
  core package builds.
  
#### Continue role as astropy.io.ascii maintainer.

- Investigate integration of the `loadtxt` C parser available with Numpy 1.23.

#### Support for Software Operations in responding to support requests:

- Monitor Openastronomy Discourse, Facebook Python in Astronomy groups, Slack channels, mailing
  list and Github issues for questions in need of response, identifying potential assignees.

- Review PRs especially from new/first time contributors.

### Budget
currency: US $

- Contractor fees: 8 hours weekly for a total of 400 hours @ $120 / hour

- TOTAL: $48,000

Tentative; expanded from the 2021 request to support increased activity in my new roles;
with the approved amount some work like `specutils` contributions had to be scaled down.
Some of the spectroscopy-related tasks here may overlap with other proposals, core targets
of this proposal could probably be realised with a $24,000 budget.
