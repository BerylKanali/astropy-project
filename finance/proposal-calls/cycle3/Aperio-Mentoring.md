## Astropy Maintainer Mentoring Program Proposal

### Project team

The grant will go to [Aperio Software Ltd.](https://aperiosoftware.com), and the
following people will be working on the project:

* Thomas Robitaille
* Stuart Mumford
* Drew Leonard

## Project Summary

In Cycle II, we proposed and were awareded a proposal to set up a lightweight
(as in easy to run and maintain) but formal mentoring program to encourage,
recruit, and train both new maintainers for the astropy core and coordinated
packages, as well as people into other roles. The current draft of the mentoring
scheme can be seen at https://astropy-mentoring.readthedocs.io. In Cycle II, we
did not yet start running the scheme, so in this Cycle III proposal we are asking
for funding to run the scheme for the first year.

### Project Work Plan

The goal will be to run the mentoring scheme for a year, as described in
https://astropy-mentoring.readthedocs.io.

### Budget

TBD - dependent on extension of Cycle II funding.
