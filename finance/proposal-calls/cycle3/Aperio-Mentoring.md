## Astropy Maintainer Mentoring Program Proposal

### Project team

The grant will go to [Aperio Software Ltd.](https://aperiosoftware.com), and the
following people will be working on the project:

* Thomas Robitaille
* Stuart Mumford
* Drew Leonard

## Project Summary

In Cycle II, we proposed and were awarded a proposal to set up a lightweight
(as in easy to run and maintain) but formal mentoring program to encourage,
recruit, and train both new maintainers for the astropy core and coordinated
packages, as well as people into other roles. The original proposal can be
seen [here](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/finance/proposal-calls/2021-proposal/Robitaille_%26_Mumford-Mentoring.md).
The current draft of the mentoring scheme can be seen at
https://astropy-mentoring.readthedocs.io. Our Cycle II funding has been [extended](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/pull/288)
until 28 February 2023. As we have not started running the scheme yet, but plan to do so towards the end of 2022, we are requesting additional
funding in order to be able to run/administer the scheme for a year, up to the end of December 2023.

### Project Work Plan

The goal will be to run the mentoring scheme for a year, as described in
https://astropy-mentoring.readthedocs.io.

### Budget

We are requesting funding to cover 1h/week of work to run the mentoring
scheme and make updates to the documentation as required. The funding
would cover work from 1 March 2023 to 31 December 2023, i.e. 43 weeks,
and so we are requesting 43h or USD 6,450 assuming an hourly rate of
USD 150/hour (this is also our minimum useful budget).
