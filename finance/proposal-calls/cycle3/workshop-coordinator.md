### Title
Workshop Coordinator

### Project Team
This project is led by Kelle Cruz and supported by the Learn Team. The Learn Team would work together to write job description, advertise, interview, select and manage the new workshop coordinator.

### Project Description
This proposal is to fund someone to focus on supporting our ever growing user base by continuing and expanding workshop offerings for users and contributors. The [workshop curriculum](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop) covers some basics of scientific computing with Python, Astropy core functionality, as well as specialized packages usch as ccdproc, photutils, and specutils. 

It would be ideal to provide these workshops at more in person conferences, especially outside of the US, and to consider the possibility of having virtual events and/or video recordings available.
The workshops offered at the AAS meeting are very popular, with 100 attendees each. Current staffing makes it difficult to run these workshops at Summer AAS meeting, much less any other large meeting. We would also like to have more workshops at conferences hosted outside of the US. It would also be ideal for this person to help facilitate contributor workshops in addition to user workshops.

A person to focus on workshops and in-person educational efforts. 
- Coordinate Winter AAS workshop for users.
- Recruit facilitators.
- Evaluate content for user workshop and facilitate necessary updates or new content development.
- Expand user workshops to more conferences, with an emphasis on outside of the US.
- Assess sucess of workshops, figure out metrics, design surveys.
- Consider remote user workshops options.
- Work with Astropy code maintainers to develop materials for a contributor workshop.
- Engage with the Learn Team and participate in weekly Learn Telecons

### Recruitment Process
Job would be posted internally and advertised widely via the AAS Job Register. The Learn Team will select and interview candidates.

### Approximate Budget
This budget is flexible. In order to accomlish a minimal amount of work and just support the existing user workshop at AAS Meetings, $5000 might be enough to recruit someone. To support someone to lead the effort to expand to more conferences, recruit and train new facilitators, and to make progress towards an contributor workshop, I estimate the necessary budget to be $12,000/year.

This budget is just for the person's effort and does not include travel.
