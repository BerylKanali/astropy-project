### Title
Hire a community manager

### Project Team
This is an open hire, to be lead by Kelle Cruz (@kelle), Erik Tollerud (@eteq), Adrian Price-Whelan (@adrn), and any others who are interested

### Project Description
The [community engagement coordinator position](https://www.astropy.org/team.html#Community_engagement_coordinator) is currently unfilled and there's not clear eveidence that anyone wants to fill it. While this may seem like a position that requires specialized knowledge of our community, the general position of open source community manager has a lot of history of specialist professionals who work at it - e.g. [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/many-faces-community-manager), [FOSSlife](https://www.fosslife.org/what-open-source-community-manager), [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/tools/building-leadership-in-an-open-source-community/). So this proposal aims to do an open hire drawing from this pool.

Some tasks the holder of this role would take on include: 
* Monthly updates requested by NumFOCUS for their newsletter
* Discourse, Stack Exchange, and Facebook group moderation and crossposting
* Slack moderation and crossposting
* Twitter post of announcements and replies to mentions
* Help with Coordination Meetings
* Help expanding workshops to more varied users
* Help publicizing Learn Astropy resources
* Coordinating website content refresh and updates with web site maintainers
* Community and/or User Survey
* More regular updates on a blog or the main Astropy website
* New community-oriented initiatives as they come up

Which of these a particular candidate takes on may depend on their background knowledge and skillset.

Selection criteria for a hire would include:
* Experience working with or in open source projects analogous to Astropy
* Experience with or training on community manager work like that listed in the links above
* Understanding of the goals of Astropy
* Understanding of both our user and developer communities


### Approximate Budget
Roughly 24960 USD, based on 10% time over a year for someone at $120/hr.
