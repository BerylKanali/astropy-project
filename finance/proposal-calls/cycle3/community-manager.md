### Title
Hire a community manager

### Project Team
This is an open hire, to be lead by Kelle Cruz (@kelle), Erik Tollerud (@eteq), Adrian Price-Whelan (@adrn), and any others who are interested

### Project Description
The [community engagement coordinator position](https://www.astropy.org/team.html#Community_engagement_coordinator) is currently unfilled and there's not clear eveidence that anyone wants to fill it. While this may seem like a position that requires specialized knowledge of our community, the general position of open source community manager has a lot of history of specialist professionals who work at it - e.g. [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/many-faces-community-manager), [FOSSlife](https://www.fosslife.org/what-open-source-community-manager), [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/tools/building-leadership-in-an-open-source-community/). So this proposal aims to do an open hire drawing from this pool.

(Exact duties to be filled out in the review stage)

### Approximate Budget
Roughly 24960 USD, based on 10% time over a year for someone at $120/hr.
