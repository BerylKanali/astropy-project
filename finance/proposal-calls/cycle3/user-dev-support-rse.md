### Title

Research Software Engineer: User and Developer Support

### Project Team

- Adrian Price-Whelan
- TBD (please add your name if you would be interested in helping manage or coordinate
  this role!)

### Project Description

A research software engineer (RSE) position with an equivalent ~50% FTE appointment to
tackle both user-facing and developer-facing support issues, as identified and
prioritized by the Astropy community and infrastructure teams. The RSE would have a
"manager" who is an existing Astropy contributor with existing knowledge of the Astropy
core package, ecosystem, infrastructure packages, and community. The RSE is expected to
eventually work independently, but with feedback from the Manager and Astropy community.

### Project / Work

The broad scope of work for the RSE includes any efforts to support both Astropy users
and contributors, including, for a few general examples, update the Astropy core
documentation theme, automate release procedures for infrastructure packages, or
implement more specific projects related to Astropy core subpackages (some examples
given below).

The RSE position is distinct from the Software Operational Support Specialist (SOSS)
position in that the RSE is expected to take on and complete discrete *projects*, rather
than provide continuous support (e.g., monitoring issues, helping new contributors,
etc., as was included in the SOSS scope of work).

The exact projects that the RSE tackles and detailed implementation plans should be
discussed, prioritized, and fleshed out by the Astropy community and RSE together if
this funding request is accepted. A few possible projects are included below as
examples, some drawn from the [Astropy
Roadmap](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/roadmap/roadmap.md), but
these should not be considered as the exact plan of work for the RSE â€” the RSE will work
independently, so some aspects of project priority will stem from their expertise and
interest.

Example projects:
* *Restructure the Astropy developer documentation*: The current developer documentation
  pages have a wealth of content aimed at both new contributors and expert technical
  engineers, but it is mixed and hard for contributors with different skill levels to
  easily find the content most appropriate for them. The goal of this project is to
  restructure the documentation pages to provide easier pathways for potential or
  existing contributors with different skill levels to find relevant developer
  documentation they need to make a contribution. Relevant issues:
  [#11620](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/11620),
  [#11621](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/11621)
* *Explore switching the Astropy documentation theme to the Pydata theme*: Many other
  software packages that work with NumFOCUS have switched to using the [Pydata sphinx
  theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). This project would pick
  up where Madison Bray left off in exploring whether it makes sense to switch the
  Astropy documentation to this theme as well, as a way of reducing custom
  infrastructure and sharing infrastructure with other projects. Relevant issues:
  [#11520](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/11520)
* *Implement robust benchmark reporting for pull requests* ([drawn from the Astropy
Roadmap](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/roadmap/roadmap.md)): This
  project would enable a way of evaluating the performance impact of pull requests by
  tracking and benchmarking existing performance of common tasks (see, for example, the
  old [astropy-benchmarks](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-benchmarks)).
* *Implement integration testing for core, coordinated, and infrastructure packages*
([drawn from the Astropy
  Roadmap](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/roadmap/roadmap.md)):
  Ensure that coordinated and infrastructure packages have integration tests that check
  the joint usage of Astropy and these other packages together, rather than individually
  (as is often the case now).
