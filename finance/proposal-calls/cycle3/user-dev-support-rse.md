### Title

Research Software Engineer: User and Developer Support

### Project Team

- Moritz Guenther
- Adrian Price-Whelan (original plan)


### Project Description

A research software engineer (RSE) position  \to
tackle both user-facing and developer-facing support issues, as identified and
prioritized by the Astropy community and infrastructure teams. The RSE would have a
"manager" who is an existing Astropy contributor with existing knowledge of the Astropy
core package, ecosystem, infrastructure packages, and community. The RSE is expected to
eventually work independently, but with feedback from the Manager and Astropy community.
We envision about an equivalent ~50% FTE appointment, but that can be scaled up or down
based on the available budget.

### Project / Work

The Astropy Project is seeking to hire a full-time or part-time research software engineer to develop and implement new features that the community has identified as high priorities in the roadmap but that the volunteer contributors do not have the capacity to deliver, as well as address smaller, but long-standing bugs and issues in the astropy core package and the coordinated packages.

The broad scope of work for the RSE includes any efforts to support both Astropy users
and contributors, including, for a few general examples, update the Astropy core
documentation theme, automate release procedures for infrastructure packages, or
implement more specific projects related to Astropy core subpackages (some examples
given below). In particular, the RSE shall tackle a number of long-standing issues and
bugs as listed in the issue trackers for the core package and the coordinated packages;
more bugs and issues are available than can be addressed by this position, so the
choice of which ones to address will be guided by community input, and the experience
and expertise of the RSE, under the manager's supervision. To reduce the burden on volunteer
maintainers, the funded manager will perform a first review where appropriate, to keep the
effort needed for the sub-package maintainers to a minimum.

The RSE position is distinct from the Software Operational Support Specialist (SOSS)
position in that the RSE is expected to take on and complete discrete *projects*, rather
than provide continuous support (e.g., monitoring issues, helping new contributors,
etc., as was included in the SOSS scope of work).

On the other hand, the RSE shall work on the items listed on [Astropy
Roadmap](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/roadmap/roadmap.md), that the
community has already prioritized, but not yet found the resources to implement.

Example projects:
* *Restructure the Astropy developer documentation*: The current developer documentation
  pages have a wealth of content aimed at both new contributors and expert technical
  engineers, but it is mixed and hard for contributors with different skill levels to
  easily find the content most appropriate for them. The goal of this project is to
  restructure the documentation pages to provide easier pathways for potential or
  existing contributors with different skill levels to find relevant developer
  documentation they need to make a contribution. Relevant issues:
  [#11620](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/11620),
  [#11621](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/11621)
* *Implement robust benchmark reporting for pull requests* ([drawn from the Astropy
Roadmap](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/roadmap/roadmap.md)): This
  project would enable a way of evaluating the performance impact of pull requests by
  tracking and benchmarking existing performance of common tasks (see, for example, the
  old [astropy-benchmarks](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-benchmarks)).
* *Implement integration testing for core, coordinated, and infrastructure packages*
([drawn from the Astropy
  Roadmap](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/roadmap/roadmap.md)):
  Ensure that coordinated and infrastructure packages have integration tests that check
  the joint usage of Astropy and these other packages together, rather than individually
  (as is often the case now).
