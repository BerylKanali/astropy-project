### Title

Learn Astropy Full Stack Developer

### Project Team

- Jonathan Sick, of the [J.Sick Codes](https://www.jsick.codes) astronomy DevOps
  software studio, and Astropy team member in the Learn Astropy
  infrastructure role.
- The [Learn Team](https://www.astropy.org/team.html) provides collaborative
  guidance and oversight for this project, but is not funded in this proposal.
  Kelle Cruz's leadership role is covered in
  [285](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/pull/285).

### Project Description

This is a proposal to fund the maintenance and development of new capabilities
for the [Learn Astropy](https://learn.astropy.org) website and the related
infrastructure that publishes and indexes content. Learn Astropy’s mission is to
help students and astronomers learn how to effectively use Python for their
research by presenting tutorials and other content that covers the core Astropy
package, affiliated packages, and other related topics in astronomy community.
This proposal furthers that goal with two themes: incorporating new content
types and sources into Learn Astropy, and improving the overall user experience
of the Learn Astropy website.

### Project / Work

This funding provides a capacity to build out new Learn Astropy features. These
are features that the Learn Astropy team has identified, in rough priority:

- Enable “third parties” to submit their independently-published content into
  the Learn Astropy index (e.g., tutorials published by STScI and other
  observatories and archives).
- Enable full-text search of Astropy core package and affiliated package
  documentation.
- Enable search and discovery of Astropy affiliated packages.
- Enable citation of Learn Astropy’s resources through DOIs and NASA ADS
  listing, including tooling and workflows for tutorial contributors.
- Standardized hierarchical content tagging the Unified Astronomy thesaurus and
  Python API symbols.
- Website UX improvements and features, from search UI improvements,
  notifications for new/updated content, contributor documentation.
- Coordinating with infrastructure service providers, specifically
  [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com), and establishing
  open source plans or applying for funding as needed.
- Communications and collaboration with the Learn Astropy team, including
  telecons and GitHub issues/pull requests.

### Approximate Budget

Budget is for hourly labor at a suggested rate of US$120/hour. Given an expected
commitment of 16 hours a month, the expected estimated total is US$24,000.

This estimate is based on historical levels of commitment in 2021.
This number could realistically fluctuate month to month, and could increase
depending on the completion of other projects towards the end of 2022 if
mutually desired. Minimum estimate is US$11,500 given about 8 hours a month;
maximum estimate is $30,000 given about 20 hours a month.
