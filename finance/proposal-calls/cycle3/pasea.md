### Title

The Pan-African School for Emerging Astronomers 2022


### Project Team

Dr. Heidi White (University of Toronto)

Aarya Patil (University of Toronto)

Dr. Linda Strubbe (Strubbe Educational Consulting)


### Project Description

We are intending to run a three-day Python/AstroPy workshop which focuses on providing students with programming and data science skills (utilizing Jupyter notebooks developed in house and material from existing AstroPy Learn tutorials). As part of this workshop we will be featuring a half-day session introducing students to GitHub and information on how they can contribute to the AstroPy codebase (including a hands-on bug fix hack session).


### Project / Work

The Pan-African School for Emerging Astronomers (PASEA) is an experiential short course in astronomy for African university students, designed and taught by a team of astronomers and science educators from Africa and around the world. PASEA aims to build a critical mass of astronomers in Africa and exchange ideas about teaching across continents. Founded in 2013 by astronomers based at the University of Toronto and the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, this school has graduated over 240 students from West African countries, many of which are now graduate students and postdoctoral fellows worldwide. After four successful schools in West Africa, PASEA is now opening its doors to students from the entire continent and is transforming into a truly pan-African school. PASEA 2022 will take place in Livingstone, Zambia, in East Africa, in October and will accept 60 students (30 domestic, 30 international) from all African nations.

PASEA is a two-week in-person program. The first week focuses on curriculum development and professional development for instructors. The second week is the summer school, with two parallel streams for undergraduate and postgraduate students. The AstroPy workshop proposed here is intended to run as a core element of the postgraduate stream curriculum. For more information about our program, please check out our [Nature Astronomy 2021 publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01301-7).

See undergraduate students engaging in hands-on inquiry-based astronomy learning at our 2017 school in Accra, Ghana [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV620Qwnl1g) (Note: in 2017, PASEA schools were known by their previous name, WAISSYA)

In addition to this request for AstroPy Learn funding, PASEA 2022 will be financially supported by The University of Toronto's Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics, The International Astronomy Union's Office of Astronomy for Development (IAU OAD), the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy Program (DARA), the National Science and Technology Council of Zambia, and more.

#### Additional Justification of Funding Requests

As the venue for our 2022 school is located in Livingstone, Zambia, the travel costs associated with attendance by non-African instructors are significant and, therefore, travel costs comprise a large portion of our total budget. Current estimates for round-trip flights for North American team members Dr. White, Patil, and Dr. Strubbe are around 2500 USD each. We further estimate VISA and travel health visit (for vaccinations) costs for our North American instructors to total roughly 400 USD. However, the attendance of Instructors Patil and Dr. Strubbe will be absolutely essential for the success of the school as they will be lead instructors for the post-graduate and undergraduate programs, respectively.

Attendance of PASEA by international students (i.e. those originating from outside the host country) is what allows our school to be truly "pan-African". Therefore, we have included a request for funding in our maximum budget which would allow for the attendance of 3-5 additional attendees from outside Zambia.

The referenced "school/venues costs" also quoted in our maximum budget refer to basic costs of running the school. These include 1) transportation costs for instructors within Zambia and 2) meal costs for students for our scheduled "Women in Science" and "Intro to Science Communication" lunch-time roundtable sessions.
