### Title
`io.fits` developer

### Project Team
This is an open hire

### Project Description
`io.fits` is one of the most important pieces of astronomy infrastructure.  However, it currently has only one maintainer (@saimn), which implies to a potential serious "bus factor"/single-point-of-failure. Existing members of the astropy community have generally not been receptive to working on this due to the complexity of the codebase (and the fact that for many the work is simply not much fun). This FR aims to support bringing a new developer into the community who might be more willing to support this sub-package, who may or may not also end up a long-term maintainer.

This should be more populated in the next few weeks with specific tasks.

### Approximate Budget
Uncertain, depends on the concrete tasks, but I would think something in the 5-10k USD is about right as a starting point
