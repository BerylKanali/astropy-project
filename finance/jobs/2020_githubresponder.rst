GitHub First/Last Responder
===========================

The Astropy Project is looking to hire a Github first responder / last
responder. The overarching goal of this position is to improve the
first time contributor experience, reduce the technical barriers to
contributions, reduce the number of open issues, and increase the
number of merged pull requests. This is not intended to cover all
issues and PRs opened in astropy, but rather to support and lighten
the load on the rest of the volunteer community.  An ideal candidate
would be familiar with the Astropy project ecosystem and capabilities,
comfortable with its Github Development workflow, and has experience
providing supportive feedback and technical advice in online
environments.

This role includes monitoring the astropy issue tracker, add labels to
new issues, provide a friendly welcome message on issues and pull
requests, and give starting pointers for how to resolve the issue or
move the pull request forward. The “last responder” aspect of the role
includes helping to close out issues and PRs, helping with rebasing,
and troubleshooting failing tests.

We expect a commitment of about 8-10 hours/week for 12 months. We aim
for an equitable pay with a total cost (incl. overhead, fringe etc.)
<= 150 $/h to the project.
Compensation could be provided as a consulting fee or as a subaward
and since overheads and fringe benefits are handled differently in
these cases, the exact rate will be set to account for that.
The Astropy Project can pay inside or outside of the US. This is a
remote-only position.

Please send a short (one paragraph) email to finance@astropy.org with
a description of your interest in the role, your qualifications, and
any relevant experience.  If possible, please provide links to a few
examples of issues/PRs where you have been involved as a first and/or
last responder.

The Astropy project is committed to fostering an inclusive
community. The community of participants in open source Astronomy
projects is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse
set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these
differences that our community experiences success and continued
growth. See https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html for details.

The Astropy Project specifically encourages underrepresented parts of
the community to apply.

All applications received less than four weeks after this PR is merged
will receive full considerations, but you can apply until the position
is filled.


Context
=======

This is the first part time job ad / call for work proposals funded
from a grant from the Moore foundation to the Astropy project (and
administered by NumFOCUS). One purpose of this grant is to make life
easier for all the volunteers who do the hard work of developing the
Astropy Project by providing salary for some work that is very
important for the project as a whole, but requires time commitments
that are unreasonable to expect from volunteer contributors. This job
is not intended to replace current volunteer efforts, but to help out
with it and ensure that someone will do the work described below even
if volunteers are not available.  If you have suggestions on the
process of job ads and spending grant money in general, please contact
the interim finance committee at finance@astropy.org or use the issue
tracker of https://github.com/astropy/project .
