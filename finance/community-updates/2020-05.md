What the interim finance committee is doing

Back in February, we, the Astropy Interim Finance Committee, sent an introduction to this mailing list [1]. The committee is charged with overseeing the distribution of Astropy's funds. The idea is that this committee is temporary, and will be reenvisioned when the project decides on a new governance structure.

The members of this committee are:

- Kelle Cruz
- Moritz Guenther
- John Swinbank
- Erik Tollerud
- Steve Crawford (Ombudsperson) 

We promised to briefly update you every couple of months [1] on our activities and how money is spent. Here are the highlights from the work we’ve done so far :

- Astropy’s major funding right now is a grant from the Moore
  foundation. Our major work is to manage and distribute those grant
  funds. We draft work statements and budgets for core team members to
  work on the project needs described in that proposal. Our primary
  focus has been on supporting people in [named
  roles](https://www.astropy.org/team.html).

- One of the things we have struggled with is how to decide how much
  to pay people given the wide spectrum of situations and our goal of
  paying equitably. We have made some progress on this complex topic
  but welcome community input. See our [running notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/193ERJ6wMNPaNjGSWbS94KHGnojpZ_zwXxWTi9L2etSo/edit?usp=sharing) for details of
  the discussion.

- As of now, we are actively working on contracts for
  [Matt Craig](https://github.com/astropy/project/issues/63) and
  [Adam Ginsburg](https://github.com/astropy/project/issues/70).

- We compensated [Brett Morris](https://github.com/astropy/project/issues/67)
  for running workshops on Astropy in late 2019 in Belfast, Bern, and Geneva.

- Some funding in the Moore grant may be used to address the project’s
  needs as they arise. The last Astropy coordination meeting
  identified a need for a software operational support specialist who
  can help volunteers with getting started on GitHub, merging,
  rebasing etc. We have [advertised that position](https://github.com/astropy/project/blob/master/finance/jobs/2020_githubresponder.rst)
  and convened a selection committee. We are expecting a start date this summer.

- We are working with NumFOCUS (Astropy’s fiscal sponsor) on the
  processes around getting contracts and subawards drawn up and
  approved.  We are also working to improve the process of approving
  expenses.

- We’ve drafted a [policy on travel and conference attendance paid for
  by astropy](https://github.com/astropy/project/blob/master/finance/funding_requests.md).

See the [issues labeled “finance” in the astropy project repo](https://github.com/astropy/project/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22finance+%3Amoneybag%3A%22) and the full notes from our meetings for more details:

You can make suggestions for things that need to be funded by opening an issue in https://github.com/astropy/project/ or by emailing finance@astropy.org or in the #finance-committee channel on slack.
