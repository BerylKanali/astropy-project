Dear Astropy Community,

The Finance Committee would like to give you some updates on our activities
over the last several months.


# Cycle 3 Funding Results

We recently completed the proposal process for allocating the next round of
funding for projects and other major expenses. This is the first time we have
been able to allocate money from our NASA ROSES-2020 grant as well as our
grant from the Moore Foundation.

A total of 22 proposals were received, of which 20 were allocated funds.
Although our budget didn't quite stretch to supporting all projects at their
full requested level, every approved proposal receives at least their minimum
funding request, and ‚Äî¬†in many cases ‚Äî substantially more.

The full list of proposals funded in this process is available at [1]. Each
proposal has been allocated a dedicated Finance Committee member who will guide
the project team through the process of getting started and claiming funds.

We're excited to be able to fund so many amazing projects! Thanks to those
who submitted proposals and to everybody who took part in the discussion and
voting process, and many congratulations to the successful project teams!

Finally, the Finance Committee welcomes feedback on the funding process. Please
feel free to reach out to us ‚Äî see the contact details below ‚Äî¬†with your thoughts
and suggestions for how it might be improved in the future.

# Keeping Track of Work in Progress

The Finance Committee uses GitHub issues to discuss and track the progress of
the various funded activities. If you would like to know where the Project's
funds are being spent, check out the ‚Äúfinance‚Äù label in the astropy-project
issue tracker [2].

For previous funding rounds, we've used a single issue to keep track of all
the various projects [3]. During Cycle 3, we plan to use a single issue per
project; watch out for these appearing over the next few days.

# Open Collective

Over the spring and summer of this year, NumFOCUS ‚Äî¬†the organization that
manages our accounts ‚Äî switched to using Open Collective [4] for handling
budgeting and invoicing. This new system is a substantial step forward ‚Äî it's
easier to use and more transparent than ‚ÄúRocket‚Äù, its predecessor, was.

All invoices must now be submitted through Open Collective. This process is
straightforward, but it is important that you know which of our various
funding lines (or ‚Äúprojects‚Äù in Open Collective's jargon) you should submit
your expense to (NASA, Moore, etc). If you aren't sure, reach out to the
Finance Committee (details below) to check. When you know which project to
use, head over to the Astropy area on Open Collective [5], select the right
project, and then hit ‚Äúsubmit expense‚Äù.

As always, don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions.
