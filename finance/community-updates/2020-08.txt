Dear Astropy Community,

The Interim Astropy Finance Committee has made significant progress over
the last few months. We wanted to take this opportunity to provide you
with some updates on our work, and reminders about ongoing activities.

- We'd like to remind you about the ongoing call for proposals on the
  topic of Inclusion, Diversity and Empowerment [1]. We invite members of
  the community to submit proposals by the end of August, and have
  allocated funding of up to $15,000 to support them. At time of
  writing, five proposals have been submitted [2], and we encourage
  everybody to consider and discuss them on the appropriate pull
  requests. Questions about the proposal process can be directed to the
  FAQ [3].

- We are pleased to announce Madison Bray is joining the project again
  as the Astropy Software Operational Support Specialist.  Madison
  started on August 1 and will be providing support for issue
  management, helping with pull requests, and improving the contributor
  experience. Madison helped set up much of the early infrastructure for
  the project, and it is our pleasure to welcome them back!

- We have awarded sub-awards to Matt Craig [4] and Adam Ginsburg [5] to
  support their work on the Astropy project.

- For the remaining core developer funds, we decided that it was best to
  share this equally among the core contributors that were interested
  and able to accept funding for this year.   We were then able to offer
  support of up to $11,000 to the following contributors: Kelle Cruz,
  Adrian Price-Whelan, Lia Corrales, Tom Robitaille, Stuart Mumford, Ole
  Streicher, Derek Homeier, Stuart Littlefair, Juan Luis Cano Rodrigues,
  and Miguel de Val-Barro.  Once finalized, the scopes of work will be
  posted to issue project/#113 [6].

- In addition, the finance committee has also supported a new contract
  to include software for Kepler/TESS into the Astropy Ecosystem.

- Finally, we are sorry to announce that Steve Crawford will be stepping
  back from the Interim Finance Committee as he moves on to other
  opportunities. The rest of the committee extends our heartfelt thanks
  to Steve for his contributions, both to this committee and to the
  wider Astropy project. We couldn't have achieved all the above without
  him!

The committee is now in the process discussing allocation of funding for
the second year of the Moore Grant. If you would like to be more
involved in these discussions, please nominate yourself  to join the
committee by sending an email to the Coordination Committee:
coordinators@astropy.org. We are especially interested in nominations of
folks based from outside the United States or with a diversity of
experiences.

For more information on our activities, please see the issues labeled
“finance” in the Astropy project repo [7], or peruse the notes from our
weekly meetings [8]. You can make suggestions for things that need to be
funded by opening an issue in https://github.com/astropy/project/, by
emailing finance@astropy.org, or by joining us in the #finance-committee
channel on Slack.
