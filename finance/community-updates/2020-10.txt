Dear Astropy Community,

Once again, the Interim Finance Committee would like to give you some updates
on our activities over the couple of months.

- The process for selecting Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity in Astropy (IDEA)
  proposals has been completed [1]. We were delighted with the high-quality of the
  proposals received, and with the community discussion which resulted. Thanks
  to everybody who took part!

  Based on this process, two proposals have been funded: one to fund an
  Astropy intern through Outreachy [2] and the other to develop a peer
  mentoring network for women of color and other marginalized groups through
  WoCCode [3]. We're really excited to see these projects make progress!

  It's worth noting that two other proposals, which were focused on conference
  attendance, were funded from the travel budget rather than the IDEA budget.

  We very much hope to be able to issue further calls for proposals in this
  area in the future. Further, we plan to use a development of the
  collaborative selection process developed here for other funding decisions.
  Given both of those, we'd love to hear feedback from the community on how
  our process could be improved.

- We're pleased to announce that a proposal entitled “Kicking Off Scientific
  Software Engineering Learning Resources with the Astropy Learn Project” [4],
  submitted by Marten van Kerkwijk, Erik Tollerud, and Kelle Cruz to the
  Dunlap Seed Funding program at the University of Toronto, has been accepted.
  This provides a total of $CAD 31,023 to develop a set of educational
  resources around packaging scientific software and to make them available
  through Learn Astropy [5]. We hope this marks the start of a long-term
  collaboration between Astropy and the Dunlap Institute.

- NASA has announced a call for proposals for “Support for Source Tools,
  Frameworks, and Libraries” [6] as part of the ROSES-2020 [7] funding
  programme. According to the call, they expect to award a total of $1.5M (US)
  spread over 5–10 different projects. This is a fantastic opportunity for
  Astropy! Over the next few weeks, the Interim Finance Committee will aim to
  coordinate a proposal. For now, we invite you to use astropy-project #161
  [8] to start brainstorming your ideas.

- As previously announced [9], the bulk of our funds available for supporting
  core developers this year have been allocated to core contributors who were
  interested in and able to accept funding. Statements of work for all of
  these positions have now been finalized, and are available online [10].
  Folks are hard at work, and the Finance Committee has been processing and
  approving invoices and NumFocus has been issuing payments.

- The next major project the Interim Finance Committee plans to undertake as
  part of the Moore grant is to issue a broad call for proposals for projects
  to make improvements to any part of Astropy, including the core repository,
  coordinated and affiliated packages, infrastructure, tutorials, workshops,
  etc. In an effort to limit the burden on the community of large-scale
  governance and planning discussions, we play to release this call after the
  ongoing discussion over APE0 [11] has concluded. Before we release the call,
  the community will have the chance to discuss the process we will use for
  selecting proposals.

For more information on our activities, please see the issues labelled
“finance” in the Astropy project repo [12], or read the notes from our weekly
meetings [13]. You can make suggestions for things that need to be funded by
opening an issue in https://github.com/astropy/project/, by emailing
finance@astropy.org, or by joining us in the #finance-committee channel on
Slack.
