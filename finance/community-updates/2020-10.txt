Dear Astropy Community,

Once again, the Interim Finance Committee would like to give you some updates
on our activities over the couple of months.

- The process for selecting Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity in Astropy
  proposals has been completed [1]. We were delighted with the high-quality of the
  proposals received, and with the community discussion which resulted. Thanks
  to everybody who took part!

  Based on this process, two proposals have been funded: one to fund an
  Astropy intern through Outreachy [2] and the other to develop a peer
  mentoring network for women of color and other marginalized groups [3].
  We're really excited to see these projects make progress!

  We very much hope to be able to issue further calls for proposals in this
  area in the future. Further, we plan to use a development of the
  collaborative selection process developed here for other funding decisions.
  Given both of those, we'd love to hear feedback from the community on how
  our process could be improved.

- We're pleased to announce that a proposal entitled “Kicking Off Scientific
  Software Engineering Learning Resources with the Astropy Learn Project” [4],
  submitted by Marten van Kerkwijk, Erik Tollerud, and Kelle Cruz to the
  Dunlap Seed Funding program at the University of Toronto, has been accepted.
  This provides a total of $31,023 Canadian to develop a set of educational
  resources around packaging scientific software and to make them available
  through Learn Astropy [5].

- As previously announced [6], the bulk of our funds available for supporting
  core developers this year have been allocated to core contributors who were
  interested in and able to accept funding. Statements of work for all of
  these positions have now been finalized, and are available online [7]. Folks
  are hard at work, and the Finance Committee has been processing and
  approving invoices.

- The next major project the Interim Finance Committee plans to undertake is
  to issue a broad call for proposals for projects to make improvements to any
  part of Astropy, including the core repository, coordinated and affiliated
  packages, infrastructure, tutorials, workshops, etc. We plan to release this
  call after the ongoing discussion over APE0 [8] has concluded.
