## Status Legend

### Green :green_circle:
- Group or person leading effort is identified and sufficiently supported.
- Effort is already underway and/or expected to be implemented in the “near term.”

### Orange :large_orange_diamond:    
- Item is already defined (e.g., issue, APE exists), but not sufficiently underway.
- Needs more people and/or resources to make it happen. 
  - *For example, funding applied for, but not awarded.*
  
### Red :red_square:  
- Consensus of the community is that the item is a priority.
- Item won’t happen without more people/resources.
  - *For example, there’s no one available to write a funding proposal or lead recruitment efforts.*
  
## Roadmap 2021 Project Board

Issues relevant to the Roadmap goals can be added and organized on the [Astropy Roadmap 2021 Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/astropy/projects/7). The goal of the project board is to give a current overview of the status of our progress and provide access to the details of the work associated with roadmap items. It will be updated continuously.

## Functionality

- :large_orange_diamond: Provide next-generation spectroscopic reduction, analysis, and visualization tools usable by individual researchers and larger surveys.

- :large_orange_diamond: Improve support and validation for input/output of standard file formats used in Astronomy including FITS, ASDF, HDF5, and ECSV as well as compression handling and enhanced support for large tables.

- :large_orange_diamond: Improve interoperability and compatibility, while reducing duplication, amongst Astropy-affiliated packages and other community standard software.

## Hardware and Performance

- :large_orange_diamond: Improve Astropy ecosystem stability in High-Performance Computing environments, for example, and expand options for compatibility with read-only filesystems.

- :large_orange_diamond: Improve support for ARM Macs.

- :red_square: Improve and/or maintain interoperability with performant I/O file formats and libraries such as HDF5 and Dask.

- :red_square: Improve support for using Astropy tools in high-performance machine learning and data analysis frameworks, such as on GPU systems.

## Learn and User Support 

- :green_circle: Improve discoverability of documentation and educational materials by overhauling the Learn website, including implementing an integrated search functionality and building an example gallery.

- :large_orange_diamond: Expand and build on workshop offerings by recruiting and training more facilitators and expanding the geographic diversity of meetings where we offer workshops. 

- :large_orange_diamond: Expand the number and diversity of user support resources, including establishing a user-focused forum on Discourse.

- :large_orange_diamond: Generate and ingest guides and/or series of tutorials that demonstrate Astropy Project functionality in the context of astronomical research, especially focusing on spectroscopy tasks.

- :red_square: Develop tutorials suitable for use in university astronomy courses. 

## Community Building and Sustainability

- :large_orange_diamond: Increase the learning and mentoring opportunities for people interested in becoming contributors and helping to develop existing contributors.

- :large_orange_diamond: Increase inclusion, diversity, and empowerment efforts within the Astropy Project and NumFocus communities, including understanding the demographics of our communities in order to measure the effectiveness of our efforts.

## Infrastructure, Documentation

- :large_orange_diamond: Improve documentation for infrastructure setup, as well as the developer documentation.

- :red_square: Implement robust performance benchmark reporting for pull requests.

- :red_square: Implement integration testing for core, coordinated, and infrastructure packages.

## Government, Management, and Personnel

- :green_circle: Continue to establish, document, and implement a formal governance structure and hold first elections under APE0.

- :green_circle: Continue to have funds and processes available to support efforts needed by core maintainers.

- :large_orange_diamond: Develop a process for recruiting, selecting, and managing personnel to complete Project priorities that require external personnel.

- :red_square: Define and document the process for categorization of core, coordinated, and affiliated packages.

- :red_square: Improve the process for recruiting and onboarding maintainers, paying particular attention to packages that are lacking maintainers.
